              <p>Hello! My name is Baptiste I am 31 years old.<br>
                I am form France. I live in Oregon.<br>
                My first working experience was as an Car auto body repair and painter for couple years.<br>

                I love traveling and discover different work, so I quit my job and started to travel in France having a different work experience.<br>
                <br>
                I worked in south of France in a ski resort.<br>
                In the EST of France as a stand wood painter for a compagny who worked with presticious client like Chanel, Guerlain, Longchamp, Focal, DS, etc.<br>
                In the French Alpes in an hotel.<br>
                <br>
                I traveled in Australia and on a cruise to go to New Zealand. This is where I met my futur husband<br>

                I came in Oregon a first time in 2019 and had to return in France.<br>
                I found a job in a door factory.<br>
                I was supposed to come back in 2020 but covid happend.<br>
                So i stayed in France and worked in the door factory but, after two years working in a door factory, I needed a change in my life. <br>
                <br>
                I made the big decision to start a professional retraining, a 5 months bootcamp and became a web developper.<br> 
                today I'm happy and motivated to continue in this new way. <br>
